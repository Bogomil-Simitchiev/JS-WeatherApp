# JS-WeatherApp
This WeatherApp provides information about the weather and climate of a region. It tracks patterns and predicts trends. Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions of a region and can include indicators such as current temperature, humidity, or wind speed. The temperature can be in Celsium or Farenheit.

I used my knowledge of JavasScript, HTML and CSS to create this app. It includes Async/await functions, Bootstrap library, understanding of modules and responsive CSS.
